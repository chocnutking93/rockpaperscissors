# Rock-paper-scissors
First Javascript Program app

At first I tried using buttons as the option for rock, paper, and scissors due to seeing everyone's code
being a click button option. This lead to me being more confused and frustrated due to not understanding
the syntax and logic behind each button choice and function. 

I ended up discarding this button choice idea and decided to use the prompt command instead. I've come to a 
better understanding of arrays, string, and if/else statements.
